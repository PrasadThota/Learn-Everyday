Media Manager

Base it on a few threads, that perform somewhat independent threads.

All of them work off of a single queue of items to process.

High level threads.
- T1 to search the machine and add the pictures and movies to a queue.
- T1 also processes them, and adds metadata (define what this is) to each media element.
	- DateTaken
	- source location
	- Dest location
	
- T2 walks the que, and copies the media element to the detination location.
	- As it finishes the copy it emits a summary element to the 'Summary que'
	- Summary element contains the following
		- Size of the file, time elapsed during the copy
	- uber summary contains the following
		- Total number of images processed 
		- Total time in seconds to process images
		- Total time spent copying
		
		- Same three elements for movies.
	[OPEN] - How does T1 notfify T2

- T3 - a summarizing thread goes through the summary que, and writes this out to an XML file

- Once all of these threads are done processing, emit the meta summary at the top of the file and exit.
