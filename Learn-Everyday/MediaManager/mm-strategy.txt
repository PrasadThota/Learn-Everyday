Media Manager

Base it on a few threads, that perform somewhat independent threads.

All of them work off of a single queue of items to process.

High level threads.
- T1 to search the machine and add the pictures and movies to a queue.
- T1 also processes them, and adds metadata (define what this is) to each media element.
	- DateTaken
	- source location
	- Dest location
	
- T2 walks the que, and copies the media element to the detination location.
	- As it finishes the copy it emits a summary element to the 'Summary que'
	- Summary element contains the following
		- Size of the file, time elapsed during the copy
	- uber summary contains the following
		- Total number of images processed 
		- Total time in seconds to process images
		- Total time spent copying
		
		- Same three elements for movies.
	[OPEN] - How does T1 notfify T2

- T3 - a summarizing thread goes through the summary que, and writes this out to an XML file

- Once all of these threads are done processing, emit the meta summary at the top of the file and exit.

Write the program using basic queues, locks
Write the same program using BoundedCollection<T>

	- Time for processing
	- Time for copying

Total
